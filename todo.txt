- Heredoc

- 64Kb piping problem

- Consecutive redirect out should create all files if nonexistant but only output to last one e.g "ls > out1 > out2" 
will create out1 and out2 but only write into out2. Currently we don't create out1. *** I think we just need to handle 
redirect out as linked list same as you did for redirect in, I'm leaving this one for you as you're more familiar with it

- cat | cat | ls (from eval sheet)


IN PROGRESS // replace everywhere

- use set_env_var(t_program **program, char *key, char *value) instead of ugly call to ft_export every time

- enum for exit codes

- call to ft_error instead of consecutive ft_putstr_fd

AT THE END

exit routine function that frees everything

exit routine called on all failed malloc returns

why ctrl+d segfaults

fix leaks

norm
