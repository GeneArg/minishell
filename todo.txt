- export GHOST=123 | env | grep GHOST shouldn't output anything as env doesnt know about export yet

- Heredoc




IN PROGRESS // replace everywhere

- use set_env_var(t_program **program, char *key, char *value) instead of ugly call to ft_export every time

- enum for exit codes

- call to ft_error instead of consecutive ft_putstr_fd



AT THE END

exit routine function that frees everything

exit routine called on all failed malloc returns

fix leaks

norm
